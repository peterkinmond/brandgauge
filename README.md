AngelHack SF Spring 2012 project by Wayne Mak, Ryan Weald and Peter Kinmond

Back in March 2012 a couple of buddies from [Sharethrough](http://www.sharethrough.com/) ([Wayne Mak](https://github.com/waynemak) 
and [Ryan Weald](https://github.com/rweald)) and I entered a hackathon called AngelHack. 
We had from 9am Sat to 6pm on Sun to create an app from scratch and prepare a demo and video.
We decided to try to figure out the reaction to a brand's advertising campaign by measuring sentiment analysis on Twitter. We ended up working 
a lot but still managed to get a good amount of sleep each night.
 
There were 2 simultaneous hackathons happening: ours in San Francisco and another in Boston. The judges picked a top 10 teams from both
who would then have an extra 24 hours to polish their project and present it in the finals. We managed to come in 3rd in the SF round and 
pitched our project to Dave McClure and others. Overall it was an awesome weekend and we all learned a lot. 

[This is the demo video we submitted which explains our basic idea.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCxpE_so2k4)

We originally had our code in a private repo - I've created a public version of it here with some of the config files and passwords/keys removed.
